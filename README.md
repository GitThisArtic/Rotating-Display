# Rotating-Display
Overview

In this project I used Fusion 360 to design and print a functioning rotating display. The display is made up of 4 essential parts, that being the housing, gearbox, platform, and motor. The housing’s floor is made of 2 essential rings: an inner ring where the motor’s extrusion fits and an outer ring that connects the base to the housing walls which contains a gap for the motor’s cable and a set of brackets. Resting on said brackets is a 2 stage planetary gearbox with 49:1 gear ratio which is secured into place via an extruding notch on the ring gear. Lastly, the display’s platform connects to the gearbox and utilizes an extruding inner ring to remain stable when objects are placed atop.
